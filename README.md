# Project-2
This project predicts 'Bad Buys' in car auctions using logistic regression. Three models were built—baseline, feature-selected, and optimized—evaluated by accuracy and McFadden's R². The optimized model balanced performance best. Future steps include regularization and exploring advanced ML models.
